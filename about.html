        Sulong is an end-to-end solution geared towards public utility vehicles that aims to generate passive income for
        PUV operators and cooperatives, lower the costs and barriers of entry for advertisers, create value for
        investors and the general riding public by providing realtime status of PUVs to shareholders and franchise
        operators, as well as provide peace of mind to the riding public by providing jeepney occupancy and location
        status.

        Enter the Hub, the Hub is an all-in-one smart device for your public fleet needs. The Hub aims to bridge the
        gap between the lack of public transit and commuter demand through a digital platform that enables users to
        monitor the whens and wheres of PUVs, reserve seats in advance to avoid overcrowded loading zones, and pay
        conveniently using a beep card or hub card, all while augmenting PUV operators an additional income stream by
        retrofitting PUVs with digital out-of-home advertisements. Now, most people will say that digital signages are
        expensive to purchase upfront and maintain, but did we mention that the Hub is free? This includes upfront
        installation and maintenance so fleet operators can have ease of mind when deploying this on their vehicles.

        The Hub is a mixture of both software and hardware, consisting of a mobile app and website whose functionality
        is tied with hardware made up of a Raspberry Pi and various sensors and monitors that will be installed in
        PUVs. The hub will have several modules to choose from, one of which essentially includes a digital billboard
        that is connected to the internet to enable advertising companies to perform live digital transmissions to all
        retrofitted PUVs. Aside from the digital billboard, a GPS (Global Positioning System) tracker and several
        ultrasonic scanners module shall also be embedded with the component so that commuters are able to track the
        locations and headcount of the PUVs through an app or website which will be accessible from mobile phones, or,
        possibly, through stations which may be situated near places where PUVs usually stop. This idea can give PUV
        operators additional revenue while simultaneously helping alleviate some of the country's transportation
        issues. The Hub will also be open to third party developers who may think of other ways to further enhance the
        capabilities of the smart device.
